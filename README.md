Finish Date: 09/13

Hours Spent: 20 hours


### Tutorial and other Resources Used

### Resource Attributions


### Running the Program

Main class: Main

Data files needed:  

Key/Mouse inputs: 

Most keyboard inputs from the lab where the first letter of the algorithm is the shortcut of the solver. 
"p" as the pause/resume button. Buttons on the maze display are clickable, and the slider is draggable. 

Known Bugs: 

The solver might not end the search properly when the user drags the frame rate slider right before the search ends
Probably need additional event handlers to solve the particular issue.


### Notes/Assumptions

The assumption is that the play does not adjust the frame rate too frequently so that the animation can continue functioning properly.
